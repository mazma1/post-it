## Structure
PostÂ it is a simple React application that consumes a Node REST API on an Express server. The API allows users do the following:
1. Sign up and log in to their accounts.
2. Create groups 
3. Add users to a group
4. Post messages to a group
5. Retrieve all the messages posted to groups the user belongs to
6. Retrieve the groups a user belongs to
7. Retrieve the members of a group


## To get started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mazma1/post-it`
2. Ensure you have installed NodeJS and Postgres
3. Navigate into the app's root directory: `cd post-it`
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory using the sample `.env.sample` file
5. Install all dependencies: `npm install`
6. Run tests to ensure the app is not broken: `npm test`
7. Run `npm run db:migrate` to populate your database with initial user data
8. Start the app: `npm run start:dev`


## Available Functionalities on Client
1. Signup
2. Signin
3. View groups on message board
4. View messages in respective groups
5. Post messages to groups
6. View members of a group
7. Add user to group
8. Create new group



## API End Points

Access to endpoints are restricted based on the authorization token assigned to the user. This token is generated when a new user signs up, and when a returning user signs in.
