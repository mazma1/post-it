## Structure
PostÂ it is a simple React application that consumes a Node REST API on an Express server. The API allows users do the following:
1. Sign up and log in to their accounts.
2. Create groups 
3. Add users to a group
4. Post messages to a group
5. Retrieve all the messages posted to groups the user belongs to
6. Retrieve the groups a user belongs to
7. Retrieve the members of a group


## To get started
1. Clone the repository and run `npm install`. 
2. To start app, navigate to the root directory of the app and run  `node run start:dev`.
This will fire up the app, with *nodemon* that watches the app for any changes.

Ideally, the server should serve the client on port 3000. So visiting `localhost:3000` on your browser will take you to the index page where you are expected to sign up as a new user. If you are a returning user, you will either have to sign in or be redirected to your message board (if your session has not expired).


## Database Setup
The application requires a PostgreSql database to handle it's data. The model, migration and seed files are available in their respective folders in the server directory. 

#### To run the migrations:
`sequelize db:migrate`

#### To run the seeds:
The seed files have to be run in the folowing order to avoid running into model dependency errors:

`sequelize db:seed --seed <user-seed>`

`sequelize db:seed --seed <group-seed>`

`sequelize db:seed --seed <message-seed>`

`sequelize db:seed --seed <group-member-seed>`
